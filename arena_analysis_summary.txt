Arena Allocator - Static Analysis Summary
==========================================

File Sizes:
- parser.go: 7.3MB (contains 100 arena allocation sites)
- yy_parser.go: 14K (contains arena integration)
- ast_arena.go: 267 lines (arena implementation with P0 fixes)
- ast_arena_p0_test.go: 218 lines (P0 safety tests)

Arena Allocation Analysis:
- Total arena sites: 100
- FuncCallExpr: 65 sites (highest impact)
- BinaryOperationExpr: 16 sites
- UnaryOperationExpr: 7 sites
- SubqueryExpr: 6 sites
- Other expression types: 6 sites

Integration Analysis:
- Arena field added to Parser struct: ✅
- Arena initialization in constructor: ✅
- Arena reset in ParseSQL(): ✅
- Arena reset in Reset(): ✅

P0 Safety Fixes Implemented:
- C1 (Memory allocation failure): defer/recover protection ✅
- C2 (Unsafe pointer validation): bounds checking ✅
- C3 (Integer overflow): size validation ✅
