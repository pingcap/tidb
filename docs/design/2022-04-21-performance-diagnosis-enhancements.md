## Introduction

To enhance the diagnosis and tuning of TiDB, this RPC proposes some optimization of metrics, including the supplement of metrics, better display in Grafana.

## Motivation or Background

TiDB collects many metrics, but few of them are frequently used and the metrics of the critical paths are in different panels, which makes the diagnosis a problem. Furthermore, some latency events are not recorded in critical paths.

This RPC proposes some improvements to the metrics collection, and display.

## Detailed Design

### Differences Between Internal and External Requests

The tracking issue of it is #33963, and it should be applied to most of the metrics.

#### Internal Transaction Usage

The main goal of this task is to differentiate the internal and external transactions and mark the snapshots and transactions as internal for internal sessions and tasks.

Some tasks are not running in the internal sessions, however, they are executed directly by `RunInNewTxn` :

- DDL Backfill
- Auto-ID management
- Version check when bootstrapping
- GC placement and label rules
- Load data for cached tables
- Alloc global ID for some operations
    - Write sequence update to binlog
    - Create temporary table

When TiDB bootstrapping, it’ll create some internal sessions, these sessions are used for:

- Bind info read/write
- Privilege read/write
- System variable read/write
- Telemetry report
- Statistic load

The coprocessor request, transaction, and snapshot created by `RunInNewTxn` and the internal sessions need to be marked as internal.

#### kvproto

Add a field `request_source` in the proto, which is a string type field and can be empty(TiDB does not allow empty `request_source`). The string type can make the metrics display more readable.

```diff
// Miscellaneous metadata attached to most requests.
message Context {
    reserved 4;
    ...
+   // The source of the request.
+   string request_source = xx;
}

```

#### Session

`SessionVars.InRestrictedSQL` indicates whether the session is used for internal transactions.

#### Coprocessor

```diff
// Request represents a kv request.
type Request struct {
	...
+	RequestSourceScope string
+	RequestSourceType string
}
```

#### KV Client

Add in transaction and snapshot.

```diff
// KVTxn contains methods to interact with a TiKV transaction.
type KVTxn struct {
	...
+	RequestSourceScope string
+	RequestSourceType string
}
```

```diff
// KVSnapshot implements the tidbkv.Snapshot interface.
type KVSnapshot struct {
	...
+	RequestSourceScope string
+	RequestSourceType string
}
```

In TiDB, `request_source` is concatenated by **RequestSourceScope(scope)** and **RequestSourceType(type)**, the scope is one of "internal" and "external", for type, there will be some variation between internal and external transactions.

The type of the internal transactions would be their capabilities, the internal transactions are listed in the [Internal Transaction Usage](#internal-transaction-usage) section. The concatenated `request_source` would be like "internal_ddl_backfill_index", "internal_bindinfo_load", "internal_statistic_load", etc.

The type of external transaction is the statement type. The concatenated `request_source` would be like "external_select", "external_insert", "external_commit", etc.

#### Metrics in TiDB

After the internal and external transactions are differentiated, we can attach the flag to metrics of requests and KV client.

Metrics need to be collected in both internal and external ways:

- The metrics in read requests
    - Get
    - BatchGet
    - Coprocessor
    - Scan
    - UnionScan
- The 2PC related metrics
    - Pessimistic Lock
    - Prewrite
    - Commit

Metrics collected for external transactions only:

- Resolve Lock(but need to be differentiated by read and write)
- Region Cache

Metrics collected together:

- Batch System
- gRPC

### Metrics Enhancement

Since #34106 already listed the metrics to be collected, this RFC only designs the panels where the metrics need to be displayed.

#### Performance Overview Dashboard

- The metrics in common path
- Retry duration(all requests except the last successful one)
    - Get
    - BatchGet
    - Scan
    - Coprocessor
    - Pessimistic Lock
    - Prewrite
    - Commit
- Wait duration
    - Coprocessor
    - Pessimistic Lock
    - Prewrite
    - Commit
- Keys count and KV size
    - Get
    - BatchGet
    - Scan
    - Coprocessor
    - Pessimistic Lock
    - Prewrite
    - Commit
- Region Cache
- TSO by types
    - Sync
    - Async

#### Batch Client Panel

- Batch System
- gRPC

## Impacts & Risks

By collecting more metrics, more traffics will be consumed. We also need to reduce some unused metrics, but it’s not the goal of this RFC.
