# Proposal: Keyspace
* Authors: [ystaticy](https://github.com/ystaticy), [iosmanthus](https://github.com/iosmanthus), [AmoebaProtozoa](https://github.com/AmoebaProtozoa),[zeminzhou](https://github.com/zeminzhou)


## Motivation
We hope to store data of multiple applications in a TiKV cluster.
For example in multi-tenant scenario. A common solution is to add a prefix in front of the key to distinguish the data of multiple applications.
So we introduce a new concept 'Keyspace' to describe the logical of the isolation with different business scenarios in a TiKV cluster.

## Architecture

This section we will describe the Architecture of the framework when using keyspaces.

### PD

PD is responsible for Keyspace Meta management. It provides HTTP and RPC interfaces to create, load, and change state and configuration keyspace meta. All other components get the keyspace meta from PD.

### TiDB

After creating the keyspace, a specified keyspace can be configured on more than one TiDB instance, which forms the TiDB cluster of the specified keyspace. However, a TiDB instance cannot serve more than one keyspace at a time. 

### Client-go

Client-go in TiDB uses codec V2 to [add keyspace prefix](https://github.com/tikv/rfcs/blob/master/text/0069-api-v2.md#key-encoding) when the keyspace is set, the current TiKV client can only read and write data from the current keyspace.

### TiKV

In TiKV, different keyspace will distinguish by different data key prefix.

### TiFlash

In TiFlash, requests for TiFlash also carry keyspace prefix and data structures and storage paths in TiFlash also segregated by keyspaceID.

## Usage

To use TiDB with keyspace, the following configuration is required: 
1. TiKV need to [enable API V2](https://github.com/tikv/rfcs/blob/master/text/0069-api-v2.md#tikv-server).
2. The TiDB configuration set `keyspace-name` to specify which keysapce is currently served by the TiDB config.
3. BR, Lightning, Dumpling, CDC specifies the keyspace by setting keyspace-name on the command line.

## Implementation

### PD
PD provide http interface and RPC interface to create, load, change state and configuration keyspace meta, and responsible for interacting with the keyspace meta store. The user requests the create keyspace interface by specifying the keyspace name, and the keyspace meta is generated. 

**Keyspace ID** is allocated by PD createKeyspace interface. The keyspace id is assigned by auto-incrementing the id, so keyspace ids are not re-assigned. The max keyspace id is 16777216, no new keyspaces can be created after the maximum keyspace id has been reached.

[**Keyspace Meta**](https://github.com/pingcap/kvproto/blob/d9297553c9009f569eaf4350f68a908f7811ee55/proto/keyspacepb.proto#L26C1-L33C2) is created when creating keysapce, the keyspace management interface operates on the keyspace meta. The keyspace state in keyspace meta changes with the keyspace state machine. The state change logic is as follows:

### TiDB

#### Using API V2 and etcd namespace to distinguish TiKV data and etcd path by Keyspace.

1. Configure Keyspace name by setting `keyspace-name` in the configuration file.
   * When TiDB server start, it will open a TiKV driver. The driver have a TxnKV client object `tikv.KVStore`. If `keyspace-name` has been set, it will start to use `tikv.KVStore` by API V2 to access TiKV.
2. The etcd path should has different prefix by etcd namespace.
   * There is a etcd client be created when domain init. If `keyspace-name` has been set, it will add a etcd namespace when create etcd client.
   * The format of etcd namespace is `/keyspaces/tidb/$keyspaceId`.

#### TiDB BR

If "keyspace-name" is set when executing the BR command, it supports restore and backup for the specified keyspace data. BR task will parse old keyspace prefix from the source data, and get target keyspace from KVStore.codec. The old keyspace prefix and new keyspace prefix is used to update the old key prefix and new key prefix of rewrite rules. Restore checksum also requires the old and new keyspace prefixes. The backup task needs to add a target keyspace prefix when building ranges in `BackupRequest` to scan out the data of the specified keyspace in TiKV.

#### TiDB Lightning

If "keyspace-name" is set when executing the Lightning command, it will encode key to add keyspace prefix before appends rows to the SST file, and decode key before records conflicts data into TiDB table.  

#### TiDB GC

##### Concepts of GC management type:

1. Global GC: 
   - Represents the previous default GC logic; there is a TiDB calculate the global GC safe point for the whole cluster.
   - The default GC management type for keyspace is Global GC.
2. Keyspace level GC:
   - Indicates that the keyspace will advance its own GC safe point.
   - Keyspace GC-related data: min start ts, GC safe point, service safe point, stored in own path of each keyspace in PD.

Previously there was only one GCWorker leader for GC in the whole PD & TiKV cluster. After supporting keyspace level GC, for keyspace, the default GC management type is global GC. Or you can specify the GC management type as `global_gc` or `keyspace_level_gc` via keyspace meta's config `gc_management_type`. 

When a specified keyspace uses the global gc: This keyspace will have its own GCworker leader, but this GCworker leader is not responsible for calculating GC safe point and resolve locks. This keyspace will rely on the GC safe point produced by the GCworker leader of TiDB with no keyspace set in the cluster for GC, and use its own GCworker leader for delete range.

When a specified keyspace uses the keyspace level GC: This keyspace will have its own GCworker leader and compute its own GC safe point, resolve locks, and delete ranges. The keyspace level safe point information stored in PD, It is also isolated by keyspace prefix, and only GC the data below its keyspace range, without affecting other keyspaces.

### TiKV

Keyspace can only be used when TiKV [enabled API V2](https://github.com/tikv/rfcs/blob/master/text/0069-api-v2.md#tikv-server).
See more details about keyspace in TiKV in [API V2 RFC](https://github.com/tikv/rfcs/blob/master/text/0069-api-v2.md).

#### Keyspace Key encoding:

We use [Keyspace key encoding](https://github.com/tikv/rfcs/blob/master/text/0069-api-v2.md#key-encoding) to distinguish different Keyspace.When TiDB enabled Keyspace, it uses TxnKV mode. 'x' is the TxnKV key mode prefixes, after mode prefix is 3 bytes for keyspace. So there are 4 bytes in key more than the scenario which does not use Keyspace. It will start with 'x' + keyspace Id (3 bytes).

#### Client-go

Client-go should also support API V2 and Keyspace, which will make all the codec logic transparent to upper users. We currently maintain these implementations in [tikv/client-go/api-v2](https://github.com/tikv/client-go/tree/api-v2).

The new version of client-go unifies all the codec logic by introducing a new interface call `Codec`.
```go
// Codec is responsible for encode/decode requests.
type Codec interface {
	// GetAPIVersion returns the api version of the codec.
	GetAPIVersion() kvrpcpb.APIVersion
	// GetKeyspace return the keyspace id of the codec in bytes.
	GetKeyspace() []byte
	// GetKeyspaceID return the keyspace id of the codec.
	GetKeyspaceID() KeyspaceID
	// EncodeRequest encodes with the given Codec.
	// NOTE: req is reused on retry. MUST encode on cloned request, other than overwrite the original.
	EncodeRequest(req *tikvrpc.Request) (*tikvrpc.Request, error)
	// DecodeResponse decode the resp with the given codec.
	DecodeResponse(req *tikvrpc.Request, resp *tikvrpc.Response) (*tikvrpc.Response, error)
	// EncodeRegionKey encode region's key.
	EncodeRegionKey(key []byte) []byte
	// DecodeRegionKey decode region's key
	DecodeRegionKey(encodedKey []byte) ([]byte, error)
	// DecodeBucketKeys decode region bucket's key
	DecodeBucketKeys(keys [][]byte) ([][]byte, error)
	// EncodeRegionRange encode region's start and end.
	EncodeRegionRange(start, end []byte) ([]byte, []byte)
	// DecodeRegionRange decode region's start and end.
	DecodeRegionRange(encodedStart, encodedEnd []byte) ([]byte, []byte, error)
	// EncodeRange encode a key range.
	EncodeRange(start, end []byte) ([]byte, []byte)
	// DecodeRange decode a key range.
	DecodeRange(encodedStart, encodedEnd []byte) ([]byte, []byte, error)
	// EncodeKey encode a key.
	EncodeKey(key []byte) []byte
	// DecodeKey decode a key.
	DecodeKey(encoded []byte) ([]byte, error)
}
```

This interface will encode the key-related request right before it is sent to the TiKV/TiFlash/PD server, and decode the response right after it is received. This design should neat enough to make encoding and decoding transparent to the upper users.

Typically, [`codecV2`](https://github.com/tikv/client-go/blob/239ac1b2b7fc67921b00e1d51d47f3716c2c2f0c/internal/apicodec/codec_v2.go#L41) implements the `Codec` interface and all the Keyspace related codec logic.
The encode logic is trivial, but the decode logic is a little bit complicated.
To achive transparency, `codecV2` will map the region range into `[0, +inf)`, if the range is not overlapped with the current keyspace, it will return an error.
For example, if the keyspace is `[x001, x002)`, then the region range `[x003, x004)` is invalid, and `[x000, x002)` is mapped to `[0, +inf)`.

client-go provides a function called `NewCodecPDClientWithKeyspace` to create a PD client with Keyspace support. It try to fetch the keyspace id with the given keyspace name from PD, and create a `codecV2` with the keyspace id.
You could get the `Codec` within the `CodecPDClient` and use it to construct a "codeced" TiKV gRPC client.

#### Coprocessor

TiKV Coprocessor use the range in the request to determine which range it should scan.
After scanning, it will transform the key/value pair into the columnar format and begin to execute the DAG request.
However, the original code could not recognize the new format key.
So the [`RangeScanner`](https://github.com/iosmanthus/tikv/components/tidb_query_common/src/storage/scanner.rs#L20) should be modified to support the new format key by ignore the first 4 bytes if the request is using API V2.

### TiFlash

TiFlash is a columnar storage engine that serves as a coprocessor for TiKV. By accelerating TiDB queries, TiFlash improves performance. When TiDB is enabled with a keyspace, TiFlash requests also carry the keyspace prefix. TiFlash's data structures and storage paths are segregated by keyspace ID.

#### Storage

Without keyspace, TiFlash stores each table's columnar/schema data in a separate directory identified by the table ID. However, in a keyspace scenario, multiple keyspaces may share the same table ID, so the table ID alone cannot uniquely identify a table.

TiFlash's storage path structure will be as follows:
```
.
├── data
│   ├── ks_1_t_92
│   │   ├── data
├── metadata
│   ├── ks_1_db_1
│   │   └── ks_1_t_92.sql
│   ├── ks_1_db_2
│   └── system
```

Each table directory will be identified by both the keyspace ID and table ID.

#### Cache

When decoding row data into columnar format, TiFlash ignores the keyspace prefix. Table-related cache structures will be refactored into a map of `<KeyspaceID, TableID> -> <ValueType>` instead of `<TableID> -> <ValueType>`.

#### Schema sync

When syncing schema from TiDB to TiFlash, TiFlash adds the keyspace prefix to requests to TiKV for specific table schemas.

#### Request handling

TiFlash requests carry the keyspace prefix. TiFlash parses `<KeyspaceID, TableID>` from the encoded key range and uses it to route requests to the relevant table storage.

### Placement Rules

Placement rules are isolated by keyspace. TiDB must name placement rules with the keyspace prefix, such as `keyspace-<keyspace_id>-xxxx`. Additionally, the key range of some rules must be encoded.
