## Abstract
This proposal proposes a new feature that supports `pinyin` order for chinese character.

## Background
It's unable now to order by a column based on it's pinyin order. For example:

```sql
create table t(
	a varchar(100)
)
charset = 'utf8mb4' collate = 'utf8mb4_zh_0900_as_cs';

# insert some data:
insert into t values ("中文"), ("啊中文");

# a query requires to order by column a in its pinyin order:
select * from t order by a;
+-----------+
| a         |
+-----------+
| 啊中文    |
| 中文      |
+-----------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

## Proposal

`pinyin` order for Chinese character supported by this proposal will add two new collation named `tidb_utf8mb4_general_zh_cs` which are exactly same with `gbk_bin`.

choose collation ID `2048` for `tidb_utf8mb4_general_zh_cs`

> MySQL supports two-byte collation IDs. The range of IDs from 1024 to 2047 is reserved for user-defined collations. [see also](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/adding-collation-choosing-id.html)

Following SQL statements are exactly same.
```sql
select * from t order by a collate tidb_utf8mb4_general_zh_cs;
select * from t order by convert(a using gbk) collate gbk_bin;
```

## Rationale

### Compare

convert `utf8mb4` encode to `gbk` code point and sort them as code point order.

### Key

The `key` of `tidb_utf8mb4_general_zh_cs` is same as collation `gbk_bin`.

### Alternative
MySQL has a lot of language specific collation, for `pinyin` order, MySQL use collation `utf8mb4_zh_0900_as_cs`. It's a lot of work if implements `utf8mb4_zh_0900_as_cs`.


## Compatibility and Mirgration Plan

### Compatibility issues with MySQL

There is no `tidb_utf8mb4_general_zh_cs` collation in MySQL.
