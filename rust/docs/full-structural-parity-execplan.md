# Audit and remove Go/Rust structural mismatches

This is a living ExecPlan under root PLANS.md. Maintain Progress, Surprises & Discoveries, Decision Log, and Outcomes & Retrospective. The existing storage plan retains earlier repair receipts.

## Purpose and acceptance


The user requests every mismatch to be listed and removed, following TiDB Go master and its pinned client-go. Exhaustive coverage means every production source, platform/build variant, generated input, original test, fixture and support/build artifact in each owning Go package. A search hit or passing subset is not package acceptance. The rolling source starts at master 6b2781326b722f217a61852ab403350858549bd0 and integration 5503f8860883c6cd80bdd0d487d34c53787daf24. Native client-rust master is 884589f0365053c0f5bd300209751187a4811782. No new SQL features absent from Go are authorized.

## Progress


- [x] Pull integration and refresh master; clean initial tree.
- [x] Enumerate upstream scope: 856 Go package directories, 4,420 Go source/test files; 83 Rust crate manifests.
- [x] Inventory all tracked TiDB and pinned client-go artifacts and Rust gap candidates; classify confirmed mismatches separately from unreviewed evidence.
- [x] Replace partial TiPB schema ownership with the complete pinned external package inputs, generation and drift gate; validate original Go tests and Rust consumers.
- [ ] Reconcile generic insertion policy with the ordinary table owner.
- [ ] Reconcile remaining native routing/RPC and operation-lifetime owners.
- [ ] Resolve each confirmed baseline SQL/DDL/statistics failure at its owning package.
- [ ] Audit all remaining package source, variants, original tests, fixtures and integration paths; retain unreviewed status until complete.
- [ ] Run scope-specific validation, root lint, commit hook locked server build, fresh pre-push locked build; commit and push each reviewed package repair.

## Milestones and design


First produce a machine-readable package coverage inventory and a searchable candidate list. Candidate strings such as unsupported or go-parity-gap include valid Go errors and historical comments; they are evidence to review, never an automatic defect count. Keep confirmed findings with concrete Go/Rust source and validation evidence. Historical receipts cannot certify current master without rechecking changed package inputs.

The first complete dependency boundary is github.com/pingcap/tipb/go-tipb. Current Rust duplicates selected messages in four local files and compares them to this branch's older June go.mod. Master pins September fed7bc47c39d; missing messages and fields escape the one-sided comparison. Replace those inputs with the complete upstream proto/include files and generate from them. A single synchronization/check command selects the dependency from an explicit Go master revision, records the complete package and generation inputs, and verifies all source bytes/file membership. Generation remains offline from checked-in source. Do not fix only ExecType or keep a second hand-maintained enum list. Preserve native Bytes ownership and protobuf presence semantics at consumers. Translate the upstream package's original wire tests and retain existing Rust wire vectors. Any consumer changes must be mechanical adaptations to complete generated contracts, with no new executor support invented.

Next reconcile transaction insertion, statement options and operation lifetime with the actual Go owners; remove only policies whose responsibility has moved to the authoritative owner. Review all routing/cache/transport consumers before changing ownership. The previously rejected /private/tmp/client-rust-background-lifetimes.patch stays unapplied without the specifically requested authorization. Other independently authorized repairs continue.

## Validation and commands


Run regressions before production fixes and afterward. Protocol validation uses complete source checks, Rust wire tests, original go-tipb tests, affected consumer tests, and all-target compilation. Whole-repository completion requires all package coverage rows to have current, complete evidence; no keyword search can establish it. Record exact commands and results as work progresses. Publication uses TERM=xterm git -c core.hooksPath=hooks commit, then a separate cd rust && cargo build --locked -p tidb-server before normal push to hparser-integration. Native changes publish to client-rust master before synchronization. No forced pushes or hook bypasses.

## Surprises & Discoveries


The old testport manifest contains only 45 package mappings and does not describe the current 856-directory Go tree. An initial Rust source search found 2,041 lines matching go-parity-gap, not implemented, not supported yet, or unimplemented!; this is a candidate count, not a mismatch count. Go supports some of those errors itself. The last embedded run has ten failures independently reproduced on unchanged integration HEAD; their names and logs remain in remove-extra-storage-policies-execplan.md.

## Decision Log


Inventory coverage explicitly and implement package-sized owner corrections. Do not promise a complete semantic audit from partial receipts, suppress failing tests, or replace Go policies with broad defaults. Complete generated schemas are the owner of protocol declarations; Rust execution support remains a separately audited consumer.

## Outcomes & Retrospective


The full review remains in progress. The first completed repair removes the partial TiPB schema owner. It does not certify every generated-runtime behavior or SQL consumer as package-complete, and does not establish repository-wide parity.


## Complete TiPB ownership repair receipt (2026-09-30)


The source comparison at integration 5503f8860883c6cd80bdd0d487d34c53787daf24
found 157 declaration gaps against master's TiPB pin: 76 messages, 51 fields,
29 enums and one enum value. Every gap is listed in
parity/current-audit/README.md and tipb-mismatches-before.json. The new wire
regressions failed before the production change: Executor decoding retained
type 21 but discarded its field-26 ExplainForConnection body, and ExecType
rejected 21. The expression regression covers rpn_args_len field 6 as well.
The failing log is /private/tmp/tidb-full-proto-red.log.

The complete external package is github.com/pingcap/tipb/go-tipb at
v0.0.0-20260908093239-fed7bc47c39d. Its 13 generated production files,
spfresh_test.go (all nine original tests), proto sources, compiler includes,
module metadata, license, CI and build/generation artifacts are retained as
66 path/hash records in crates/tidb-proto/tipb-source.json. No platform-specific
Go implementation is present in this generated package. All 13 upstream proto
entrypoints and their imported options are compiled by prost/tonic from 28
exact checked-in source/license inputs. The sharedbytes Go representation maps
to the existing Rust Bytes field for Chunk.rows_data. Recursive executor
children use Rust Box pointers. Original Go generator/runtime support is
replaced by the existing Rust generators, without hand-editing generated code.
The tici protobuf package remains a nested Rust module. Unused protocol types
become available; their SQL execution remains separately owned and unreviewed.

Removed: four handwritten TiPB projections and two partial synchronization
scripts. Replaced them with sync-tipb.py, which requires an explicit master
revision for updates, verifies the recorded revision when available, compares
all upstream bytes/file membership and module artifacts, and rejects a changed
pin in a fetched master. Builds remain offline from checked-in inputs. The
root lint gate also runs four checker regressions. Consumer changes in
 tidb-exec, tidb-expr and tidb-unistore only supply defaults for newly represented
fields and Box pointers for recursive types; their existing encoded fields and
wire-vector tests are retained. No client-rust source or pin changed; the
current vendor already matches native master 884589f.

Exact validation commands, from rust/ unless a different directory is stated:

    cargo test --locked -p tidb-proto --test tipb_selection_expression_source complete_contract
    cargo test --locked -p tidb-proto
    cargo check --locked -p tidb-server -p tidb-proto --all-targets
    cargo check --locked -p tidb-exec -p tidb-expr -p tidb-distsql -p tidb-executor -p tidb-unistore -p tidb-planner -p tidb-txnkv -p tidb-util -p tidb-protocol -p tidb-pd-client --all-targets
    cargo test --locked -p tidb-exec --test all dag
    cargo test --locked -p tidb-exec --test all cop_scan
    cargo test --locked -p tidb-exec --test all wide_scan_selection_source
    cargo test --locked -p tidb-expr --test all pb_
    cargo test --locked -p tidb-unistore --lib cophandler::
    cargo test --locked -p tidb-distsql --test all select_result
    cargo test --locked -p tidb-server --lib pushed_conditional_signatures_evaluate_in_the_coprocessor_like_go
    cargo test --locked -p tidb-server --lib a_derived_aggregate_over_the_coprocessor_answers_its_output

The first command is the red reproduction. The complete Rust protocol suite
passes 45 tests, including both regressions and all nine translated original
SPFresh tests. The consumer/SQL commands pass 14, 11, 16, 10, 86, 20, 1 and 1
tests respectively (159 total), with two pre-existing DistSQL ignored tests.
All direct consumer targets compile. The original nine Go tests pass via
 go test ./go-tipb from the pinned module-cache directory. From repository
root, python3 rust/scripts/sync-tipb.py, python3 -m unittest discover -s
rust/scripts/tests -p test_tipb_sync.py, make lint and git diff --check pass.
Logs use /private/tmp/tidb-full-proto-*.log.

Scope-specific tests were chosen to preserve request lowering, zero-copy
response ownership, recursive executor representation and end-to-end SQL
pushdown while checking the whole generated package's original tests. No
Bazel preparation or Go failpoint toggling applies: no Go source/module/Bazel
input changed. RealTiKV, TiFlash cluster tests, full-workspace tests and
sysbench/TPC-C/TPC-H/YCSB were not run; no performance gain is claimed. The ten
previously reproduced embedded-suite baseline failures remain listed for
separate root-cause repair. Publication requires the locked server build in
the pre-commit hook and a separate fresh locked server build before push.

Inventory regeneration now includes all 41 package directories in master's
pinned client-go module, in addition to the 856 TiDB package directories. The
2,051 marker hits remain candidates only. The inventory generator records
unreviewed status by design; acceptance receipts are separate. Other external
modules still need complete inventories before any acceptance claim.
