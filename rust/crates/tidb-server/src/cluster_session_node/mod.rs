//! The convergence node: the wide-SQL session, over cluster storage, over the
//! MySQL wire.
//!
//! Every half of this already existed and was proven on its own. The session
//! driver plans and executes joins, subqueries, aggregates, window functions,
//! `SHOW` and `EXPLAIN` ([`crate::pipeline_session`] serves it over TCP against
//! an in-process catalog). [`crate::cluster_session`] binds that same driver's
//! catalog to real transactional storage (the `cluster-session-smoke` binary
//! proves it against a live cluster). [`crate::cluster_privileges`] turns the
//! cluster's own `mysql.*` rows into the registry the handshake authenticates
//! against. This module is the one node where all three run at once:
//!
//! * the catalog and the accounts are read from the cluster at boot, and the
//!   catalog keeps following the cluster's schema version;
//! * a client authenticates as an account a Go TiDB created;
//! * each connection gets its own [`Session`] whose tables read and write
//!   through [`ClusterTableStorage`];
//! * `COMMIT` publishes the connection's staged writes through the optimistic
//!   2PC, which a Go TiDB then reads back.
//!
//! # The statement lifecycle
//!
//! The connection's tables are built once, against a [`SwappableSnapshot`] slot
//! every table shares; before a statement the connection binds a snapshot into
//! that slot and afterwards takes it back -- whether the statement succeeded or
//! failed, so a failure never leaves a lock behind.
//!
//! *Which* snapshot is the connection's transaction state. Outside `BEGIN` the
//! connection opens one [`StatementSnapshot`] per statement, at its own
//! timestamp, and publishes that statement's writes right after: Go's implicit
//! per-statement transaction. The bind itself costs nothing -- the snapshot is
//! opened at the statement's FIRST read -- and one statement shape skips the
//! timestamp entirely: an autocommit point get on the clustered handle, which
//! [`ClusterServerSession::declare_read_shape`] declares to the bound snapshot
//! before the statement runs, and which then reads at `u64::MAX`. That
//! declaration is made from the STATEMENT and never from a read, because a
//! read alone cannot tell a point-get `SELECT` from an `UPDATE`'s
//! read-before-write or from one row lookup of a double read. Inside `BEGIN`
//! ... `COMMIT` the connection holds
//! one [`SessionTransaction`], every statement reads through it at the single
//! timestamp `BEGIN` took, and `COMMIT` prewrites the accumulated buffer on
//! that same transaction. That is Go's one `kv.Transaction` per session: later
//! statements do not see commits made after `BEGIN` (repeatable read), and a
//! writer that raced the transaction is rejected at prewrite as a write
//! conflict instead of being silently overwritten.
//!
//! There are FOUR doors onto that state, and the invariant is that they cannot
//! disagree: `explicit` is open exactly when the driver session says a
//! transaction is. Each door was a silently-wrong-answer bug until it was
//! routed, all with the same shape -- the driver's flag flipped, `explicit`
//! left unopened, so every statement read at a fresh timestamp and no racing
//! writer was ever detected.
//!
//! * A text `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK`, through
//!   [`ClusterServerSession::control_transaction`].
//! * A prepared one. It used to be run as an ordinary statement instead; it is
//!   now classified at PREPARE and routed to the same place, so which protocol
//!   carried it does not enter into any of this.
//! * `SET autocommit = 0`, which carries no keyword at all -- see
//!   [`ClusterServerSession::begin_if_autocommit_off`] for why the variable
//!   itself is the routing question, and
//!   [`ClusterServerSession::commit_if_session_left_transaction`] for the
//!   statement that ends the transaction from the inside.
//! * `SAVEPOINT`, which under `autocommit = 0` is Go's `Txn(true)` and so is
//!   itself a transaction opening ([`ClusterServerSession::apply_savepoint`]).
//!
//! None of them tracks transaction state here. Each asks the driver session,
//! which owns the rules; a second copy that could drift is the bug all four
//! were.
//!
//! A PREPARE is deliberately NOT a fifth door, and that took measuring: Go's
//! `PrepareStmt` does call `PrepareTxnCtx`, but the transaction it leaves is
//! *pending* -- no timestamp, `InTxn()` still false -- so under
//! `autocommit = 0` the first statement that touches data is still what opens
//! one. This node's PREPARE probe RUNS the statement to learn its result
//! columns, so it had to be routed away from the opening
//! ([`ClusterServerSession::probe_statement`]); leaving it there pinned the
//! connection's `start_ts` at PREPARE time and every later statement of that
//! transaction read a snapshot the client never asked for.
//!
//! Writes never touch the slot: they stage into the connection's
//! [`MutationBuffer`], which outlives the statement. A failed statement is
//! rolled back to the buffer snapshot taken before it ran, so an explicit
//! transaction keeps exactly the writes of its statements that succeeded.
//!
//! # DDL: the one stored-schema change this node performs
//!
//! `CREATE TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`, `CREATE DATABASE`, `DROP DATABASE`,
//! `CREATE INDEX`, `DROP INDEX`, and their single-action `ALTER TABLE`
//! spellings are not run by the session driver against
//! its own in-memory catalog -- that copy is a *read* of the cluster's schema,
//! so changing it alone would be a silently wrong answer. They are routed to
//! the [`ClusterDdl`] seam, which publishes the meta-key mutations through the
//! same optimistic 2PC the DML path uses ([`tidb_exec::real_tikv_ddl`]), and a
//! Go TiDB then sees the object.
//!
//! An index change publishes a second thing in that same transaction: the
//! entries the rows the table ALREADY holds owe it. They are staged by the very
//! `KvTable` call an `INSERT` maintains an index with, over this seam's own
//! storage -- see [`RealClusterDdl`]'s backfiller -- because an index that
//! exists and holds nothing loses rows from every query routed through it,
//! with no error anywhere.
//!
//! Two catalogs have to catch up afterwards, and they do it at different
//! moments for different reasons:
//!
//! * **The node's**, immediately. [`RealClusterDdl`] runs one reload pass
//!   inline on the statement's own thread rather than waiting up to `lease/2`
//!   for [`CatalogReloader`]'s tick -- this node is the one that wrote the
//!   change, so it needs no notification to know about it. Both publishers
//!   swap the whole catalog into the same slot, so they cannot interleave.
//! * **The connection's**, at its next statement. A connection's tables are
//!   built once, over the snapshot slot they share, so a table created after
//!   the connection opened has no entry at all; [`ClusterServerSession`]
//!   rebuilds that catalog -- against the same storage handles, leaving the
//!   slot and the staged writes untouched -- whenever the node's schema
//!   version has moved past the one the connection was built from. Never
//!   inside an explicit transaction: its statements keep the schema its
//!   `BEGIN` saw, exactly as they keep its snapshot.
//!
//! # Accounts: the other stored state this node writes
//!
//! `CREATE USER`, `DROP USER`, `GRANT`, `REVOKE` and `SET PASSWORD` are the
//! same shape of problem as the DDL above -- the account table is a *read* of
//! the cluster's `mysql.*` rows -- and take the same shape of answer: the
//! [`ClusterAccountWriter`] seam. What differs is that the statement's meaning
//! is not re-derived from the AST at all; the session driver runs it against a
//! scratch account table read from the cluster inside the change's own
//! transaction, and the seam writes back whatever that table now says.
//! [`crate::cluster_account_seam`] states why, and what a failure leaves
//! behind.
//!
//! # What this mode refuses, and why
//!
//! * Every stored-schema change the cluster DDL path cannot express: `ALTER`,
//!   `TRUNCATE`, `RENAME`, `CREATE VIEW`/`SEQUENCE`, the index shapes whose
//!   entries this node would not go on to maintain (prefix, expression,
//!   partial, `GLOBAL`, `FULLTEXT`/`SPATIAL`/`VECTOR`), and the
//!   `CREATE TABLE` clauses [`tidb_exec::table_info_build`] refuses (foreign
//!   keys, partitions, ...). Each is refused with its own reason rather than a
//!   generic unsupported error.
//! * A table the storage tier cannot lay out (a view, a sequence, a
//!   partitioned table, one mid-DDL). [`cluster_session_catalog`] reports each
//!   by name with its exact reason, and the node prints them at boot rather
//!   than letting them vanish.
//!
//! Everything else the session driver can answer -- including `SHOW` and
//! `information_schema` over the loaded catalog -- runs, and reports the
//! driver's own error where it cannot.
