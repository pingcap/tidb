# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to agents when working with code in this repository.

### Code Organization

**Package Structure:**

- `/pkg/bindinfo/` - Handles all global SQL bind operations and caches SQL bind info from storage.
- `/pkg/config/` - Configuration definitions.
- `/pkg/ddl/` - Data Definition Language (DDL) execution logic.
- `/pkg/distsql/` - Abstraction of distributed computing interfaces between executor and TiKV client.
- `/pkg/domain/` - Storage space abstraction (domain/namespace), manages information schema and statistics.
- `/pkg/errno/` - MySQL error code, message, and summary definitions.
- `/pkg/executor/` - Execution logic for most SQL statements (operators).
- `/pkg/expression/` - Expression-related code, including operators and built-in functions.
- `/pkg/infoschema/` - Metadata management for SQL statements and information schema operations.
- `/pkg/kv/` - Key-Value engine interface and public methods; storage engine adaptation layer.
- `/pkg/lock/` - Implementation of LOCK/UNLOCK TABLES.
- `/pkg/meta/` - SQL metadata management in storage engine; used by infoschema and DDL.
- `/pkg/meta/autoid/` - Generates globally unique, monotonically increasing IDs for tables and databases.
- `/pkg/metrics/` - Metrics information for all modules.
- `/pkg/owner/` - Coordinates tasks that must be executed by a single instance in a TiDB cluster.
- `/pkg/parser/` - MySQL-compatible SQL parser and AST/data structure definitions.
- `/pkg/planner/` - Query optimization logic.
- `/pkg/planner/core/base/` - interfaces for logical and physical plans.
- `/pkg/planner/core/operator/logicalop` - Logical plan operators.
- `/pkg/planner/core/operator/physicalop` - Physical plan operators.
- `/pkg/plugin/` - TiDB plugin framework.
- `/pkg/privilege/` - User privilege management interface.
- `/pkg/server/` - MySQL protocol and connection management.
- `/pkg/session/` - Session management code.
- `/pkg/sessionctx/binloginfo/` - Binlog output information.
- `/pkg/sessionctx/stmtctx/` - Runtime statement context for sessions.
- `/pkg/sessionctx/variable/` - System variable management.
- `/pkg/statistics/` - Table statistics code.
- `/pkg/store/` - Storage engine drivers, wraps Key-Value client for TiDB.
- `/pkg/structure/` - Structured API on transactional KV API (List, Queue, HashMap, etc.).
- `/pkg/table/` - Table abstraction in SQL.
- `/pkg/tablecodec/` - Encode/decode SQL data to/from Key-Value.
- `/pkg/telemetry/` - Telemetry collection and reporting.
- `/pkg/types/` - Type definitions and operations.
- `/pkg/util/` - Utilities.
- `/cmd/tidb-server/` - Main entry for TiDB service.

## Building

```bash
make bazel_prepare
make 
make gogenerate
go mod tidy
```

## Testing 

### Unit Tests

Standard Go tests throughout `/pkg/` packages

#### How to run unit tests

```bash
# in the root directory of the repository
make failpoint-enable
pushd pkg/<package_name>
go test -v -run  <TestName>  -record --tags=intest
popd
make failpoint-disable # The command should be executed regardless of whether the `go test` is successful or not.
```

- If the execution is successful, please check whether the result set file has been modified. If it has been modified, 
  Please verify that the modifications are correct and notify the developer.
- If the execution fails, please check the error message and notify the developer.

#### Unit Tests Specification

The following points must be achieved:
1. Within the same package, there should not be more than 50 unit tests. The exact number can be referenced from the `shard_count` in the `BUILD.bazel` file under the test path.
2. Existing tests should be reused as much as possible, and existing test data and table structures should be utilized. Modifications should be made on this basis to accommodate the new tests.
3. Some tests use the JSON files in `testdata` as the test set (`xxxx_in.json`) and the validation set (`xxxx_out.json` and `xxxx_xut.json`). It is necessary to modify the test set before running the unit test.

### Integration Tests

Integration tests are located in the `/tests/integrationtest` directory.

The test set is located at `/tests/integrationtest/t`, and the result set is in `tests/integrationtest/r`. The result set does not need to be modified, but it is necessary to verify its correctness after running the tests.

#### How to run integration tests

```bash
# in the root directory of the repository
pushd tests/integrationtest
./run-tests.sh -run <TestName>
popd
```

If you modify the test set `t/planner/core/binary_plan.test`, then the `TestName` will be `planner/core/binary_plan`.
