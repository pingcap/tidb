# Skills Usage

This repository stores Codex repo-level skills under `.agents/skills`.

- Current working directory (`$CWD`) is the skill root scope for Codex repo-level loading.
- Put shared repository skills here.
- Keep skill-specific references under each skill folder (for example: `tidb-test-guidelines/references/`).
