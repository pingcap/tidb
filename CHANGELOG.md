# TiDB Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. See also [Release Notes](https://github.com/pingcap/docs/blob/master/releases/release-notes.md), [TiKV Changelog](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) and [PD Changelog](https://github.com/tikv/pd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## [3.0.4] 2019-10-08
## New features
* Add system table `performance_schema.events_statements_summary_by_digest` to troubleshoot performance issues at SQL level
* Add the `WHERE` clause in TiDB’s `SHOW TABLE REGIONS` syntax
* Add the `worker-count` and   `txn-batch` configuration items in Reparo to control the recovery speed

## Improvements
* Support `Split` commands in batches and the empty `Split` command in TiKV to split Regions in batches
* Support double linked list for RocksDB in TiKV to improve performance of  reverse scan
* Add two perf tools -`iosnoop` and `funcslower` in TiDB Ansible to better diagnose the cluster state
* Optimize the output of slow query logs in TiDB by deleting redundant fields

## Changed behaviors
* Update the default value of `txn-local-latches.enable` to `false` to disable the default behaviour of checking conflicts of local transactions in TiDB
* Add the `tidb_txn_mode` system variable of global scope in TiDB and allow using pessimistic lock by default. Note that TiDB still adopts optimistic lock by default.
* Replace the `Index_ids` field in TiDB slow query logs with `Index_names`  to improve the usability of slow query logs
* Add the `split-region-max-num` parameter in the TiDB configuration file to modify the maximum number of Regions allowed in the `SPLIT TABLE` syntax
* Return the `Out Of Memory Quota` error instead of disconnect links in TiDB when a SQL execution exceeds the memory limit
* Disallow dropping the `AUTO INCREMENT` attribute of columns in TiDB to avoid misoperations. To drop this attribute, change the `tidb_allow_remove_auto_inc` system * variable.  

## Fixed Issues
* Fix the issue in TiDB that the special syntax `PRE_SPLIT_REGIONS` does not  replicate data to the downstream by using notes
* Fix the issue in TiDB that the slow query logs are incorrect when getting the result of `PREPARE` + `EXECUTE` by using the cursor
* Fix the issue in PD that adjacent small Regions cannot be merged
* Fix the issue that too many file descriptors are opened in idle clusters
* Fix the issue that

## [2.1.0-GA] 2018-11-30

### Upgrade caveat
* TiDB 2.1 does not support downgrading to v2.0.x or earlier due to the adoption of the new storage engine
* Parallel DDL is enabled in TiDB 2.1, so the clusters with TiDB version earlier than 2.0.1 cannot upgrade to 2.1 using rolling update. You can choose either of the following two options:
    - Stop the cluster and upgrade to 2.1 directly
    - Roll update to 2.0.1 or later 2.0.x versions, and then roll update to the 2.1 version
