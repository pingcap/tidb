# Security Vulnerability Disclosure and Response Process

TiDB is a fast-growing open source database. To ensure its security, a security vulnerability disclosure and response process is adopted.

The primary goal of this process is to reduce the total exposure time of users to publicly known vulnerabilities. To quickly fix vulnerabilities of TiDB products, the security team is responsible for the entire vulnerability management process, including internal communication and external disclosure.

If you find a vulnerability or encounter a security incident involving vulnerabilities of TiDB products, please report it as soon as possible to the TiDB security team (security@tidb.io).

Please kindly help provide as much vulnerability information as possible in the following format:

- Issue title*:

- Overview*:

- Affected components and version number*:

- CVE number (if any):

- Vulnerability verification process*:

- Contact information*:

*mean required

# Response Time

The TiDB security team will confirm the vulnerabilities within 2 working days after your submission and keep in touch with you.

After a security vulnerability is fixed, we will thank the reporter publicly. However, in order to avoid negative impact, please kindly keep the vulnerability confidential before that. We would be really appreciated if you could obey the following code of conduct:

The vulnerability will not be disclosed until TiDB releases a patch for it.

Do not disclose the details of the vulnerability, such as exploits code.
