// RestrictedSQLExecutor is an interface provides executing restricted sql statement.
// Why we need this interface?
// When we execute some management statements, we need to operate system tables.
// For example when executing create user statement, we need to check if the user already
// exists in the mysql.User table and insert a new row if not exists. In this case, we need
// a convenience way to manipulate system tables. The most simple way is executing sql statement.
// In order to execute sql statement in stmts package, we add this interface to solve dependence problem.
// And in the same time, we do not want this interface becomes a general way to run sql statement.
// We hope this could be used with some restrictions such as only allowing system tables as target,
// do not allowing recursion call.
// For more information please refer to the comments in session.ExecRestrictedSQL().
// This is implemented in session.go.

	// ExecRestrictedSQL run sql statement in ctx with some restriction.

// SQLParser is an interface provides parsing sql statement.
// To parse a sql statement, we could run parser.New() to get a parser object, and then run Parse method on it.
// But a session already has a parser bind in it, so we define this interface and use session as its implemention,
// thus avoid allocating new parser. See session.SQLParser for more information.

	ParseSQL(sql, charset, collation string) ([]ast.StmtNode, error)
