	// and add `import _ "github.com/pingcap/tidb/types/parser_driver"` in the head of file.

	// 1. Create a parser. The parser is NOT goroutine safe and should
	// not be shared among multiple goroutines. However, parser is also
	// heavy, so each goroutine should reuse its own local instance if
	// possible.

	// 2. Parse a text SQL into AST([]ast.StmtNode).
	stmtNodes, err := p.Parse("select * from tbl where id = 1", "", "")

	// 3. Use AST to do cool things.
	fmt.Println(stmtNodes[0], err)
