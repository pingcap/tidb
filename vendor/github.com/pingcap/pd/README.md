PD is the abbreviation for Placement Driver. It is used to manage and schedule the [TiKV](https://github.com/tikv/tikv) cluster. 

PD supports distribution and fault-tolerance by embedding [etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd). 

## Build

1. Make sure [​*Go*​](https://golang.org/) (version 1.9+) is installed. For development, go 1.11.x is required.
2. Ensure your `$GOPATH` is set. (For example, `export GOPATH=$HOME/go`)
3. Clone the repository with `git clone git@github.com:pingcap/pd.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/pingcap/pd`.
4. Use `make` to install PD. PD is installed in the `bin` directory.

## Usage

### Command flags

See [configuration](https://github.com/pingcap/docs/blob/master/op-guide/configuration.md#placement-driver-pd).

### Single Node with default ports

You can run `pd-server` directly on your local machine, if you want to connect to PD from outside, 
you can let PD listen on the host IP.

```bash
# Set correct HostIP here. 
export HostIP="192.168.199.105"

pd-server --name="pd" \
          --data-dir="pd" \
          --client-urls="http://${HostIP}:2379" \
          --peer-urls="http://${HostIP}:2380" \
          --log-file=pd.log
```

Using `curl` to see PD member:

```bash
curl http://${HostIP}:2379/v2/members

{"members":[{"id":"f62e88a6e81c149","name":"pd","peerURLs":["http://192.168.199.105:2380"],"clientURLs":["http://192.168.199.105:2379"]}]}
```

A better tool [httpie](https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie) is recommended:

```bash
http http://${HostIP}:2379/v2/members
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{
    "members": [
        {
            "clientURLs": [
                "http://192.168.199.105:2379"
            ], 
            "id": "f62e88a6e81c149", 
            "name": "pd", 
            "peerURLs": [
                "http://192.168.199.105:2380"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Docker

You can use the following command to build a PD image directly:

```
docker build -t pingcap/pd .
```

Or you can also use following command to get PD from Docker hub:

```
docker pull pingcap/pd
```

Run a single node with Docker: 

```bash
# Set correct HostIP here. 
export HostIP="192.168.199.105"

docker run -d -p 2379:2379 -p 2380:2380 --name pd pingcap/pd \
          --name="pd" \
          --data-dir="pd" \
          --client-urls="http://0.0.0.0:2379" \
          --advertise-client-urls="http://${HostIP}:2379" \
          --peer-urls="http://0.0.0.0:2380" \
          --advertise-peer-urls="http://${HostIP}:2380" \
          --log-file=pd.log
```

### Cluster

PD is a component in TiDB project, you must run it with TiDB and TiKV together, see 
[TiDB-Ansible](https://github.com/pingcap/docs/blob/master/op-guide/ansible-deployment.md) to learn 
how to set up the cluster and run them.

You can also use [Docker](https://github.com/pingcap/docs/blob/master/op-guide/docker-deployment.md) to 
run the cluster.
