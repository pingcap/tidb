`grpc_recovery` are intereceptors that recover from gRPC handler panics.

Server Side Recovery Middleware

By default a panic will be converted into a gRPC error with `code.Internal`.

Handling can be customised by providing an alternate recovery function.

Please see examples for simple examples of use.
