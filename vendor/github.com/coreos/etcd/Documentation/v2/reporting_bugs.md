# Reporting Bugs

If you find bugs or documentation mistakes in the etcd project, please let us know by [opening an issue][etcd-issue]. We treat bugs and mistakes very seriously and believe no issue is too small. Before creating a bug report, please check that an issue reporting the same problem does not already exist.

To make your bug report accurate and easy to understand, please try to create bug reports that are:

- Specific. Include as much details as possible: which version, what environment, what configuration, etc. You can also attach etcd log (the starting log with etcd configuration is especially important).

- Reproducible. Include the steps to reproduce the problem. We understand some issues might be hard to reproduce, please includes the steps that might lead to the problem. You can also attach the affected etcd data dir and stack strace to the bug report.

- Isolated. Please try to isolate and reproduce the bug with minimum dependencies. It would significantly slow down the speed to fix a bug if too many dependencies are involved in a bug report. Debugging external systems that rely on etcd is out of scope, but we are happy to point you in the right direction or help you interact with etcd in the correct manner.

- Unique. Do not duplicate existing bug report.

- Scoped. One bug per report. Do not follow up with another bug inside one report.

You might also want to read [Elika Etemad’s article on filing good bug reports][filing-good-bugs] before creating a bug report.

We might ask you for further information to locate a bug. A duplicated bug report will be closed.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How to get a stack trace

``` bash
$ kill -QUIT $PID
```

### How to get etcd version

``` bash
$ etcd --version
```

### How to get etcd configuration and log when it runs as systemd service ‘etcd2.service’

``` bash
$ sudo systemctl cat etcd2
$ sudo journalctl -u etcd2
```

Due to an upstream systemd bug, journald may miss the last few log lines when its process exit. If journalctl tells you that etcd stops without fatal or panic message, you could try `sudo journalctl -f -t etcd2` to get full log.
