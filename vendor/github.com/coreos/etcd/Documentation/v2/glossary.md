# Glossary

This document defines the various terms used in etcd documentation, command line and source code.

## Node

It has a unique identification, and records other nodes' progress internally when it is the leader.

## Member

Member is an instance of etcd. It hosts a node, and provides service to clients.

## Proposal

A proposal is a request (for example a write request, a configuration change request) that needs to go through raft protocol.

## Client
