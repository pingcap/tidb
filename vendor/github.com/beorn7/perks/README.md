# Perks for Go (golang.org)

Perks contains the Go package quantile that computes approximate quantiles over
an unbounded data stream within low memory and CPU bounds.

A very special thank you and shout out to Graham Cormode (Rutgers University),
Flip Korn (AT&T Labs–Research), S. Muthukrishnan (Rutgers University), and
Divesh Srivastava (AT&T Labs–Research) for their research and publication of
[Effective Computation of Biased Quantiles over Data Streams](http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~muthu/bquant.pdf)

Thank you, also:

FAQ:

Q: Why not move the quantile package into the project root?
A: I want to add more packages to perks later.
