# Treat all files in this repo as binary, with no git magic updating
# line endings. Windows users contributing to Go will need to use a
# modern version of git and editors capable of LF line endings.
#
# We'll prevent accidental CRLF line endings from entering the repo
# via the git-review gofmt checks.

# See golang.org/issue/9281
