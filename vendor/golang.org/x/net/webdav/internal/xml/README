This is a fork of the encoding/xml package at ca1d6c4, the last commit before
https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/c0d6d33 "encoding/xml: restore Go 1.4 name
space behavior" made late in the lead-up to the Go 1.5 release.

The list of encoding/xml changes is at
https://go.googlesource.com/go/+log/master/src/encoding/xml

This fork is temporary, and I (nigeltao) expect to revert it after Go 1.6 is
released.

See http://golang.org/issue/11841
