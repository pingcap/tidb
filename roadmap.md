  </tr>

<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2">Support JSON</td>
    <td>Support JSON function.</td>
    <td>In business scenarios that require flexible schema definitions, the application can use JSON to store information for ODS, transaction indicators, commodities, game characters, and props.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><ul><li>Support expression indexes.</li><li>Support generated columns.</li></ul></td>
    <td>Provide query acceleration for specific field indexes in JSON scenarios.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Flashback</td>
    <td>Support cluster-level flashback.</td>
    <td>In game rollback scenarios, the flashback can be used to achieve a fast rollback of the current cluster. This solves the common problems in the gaming industry such as version errors and bugs.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>TiFlash result write-back (supports <code>INSERT INTO SELECT</code>)</td>
    <td><ul><li>Easily write the analysis results in TiFlash back to TiDB.</li><li>Provide complete ACID transactions, more convenient and reliable than general ETL solutions.</li><li>Set a hard limit on the threshold of intermediate result size, and report an error if the threshold is exceeded.</li><li>Support fully distributed transactions, and remove or relax the limit on the intermediate result size.</li></ul></td>
    <td>These features combined enable a way to materialize intermediate results. The analysis results can be easily reused, which reduces unnecessary ad-hoc queries, improves the performance of BI and other applications (by pulling results directly) and reduces system load (by avoiding duplicated computation), thereby improving the overall data pipeline efficiency and reducing costs. It will make TiFlash an online service.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Time to live (TTL)</td>
    <td>Support automatically deleting expired table data based on custom rules. </td>
    <td>This feature enables automatic data cleanup in limited data archiving scenarios.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Multi-value Index</td>
    <td>Support array index.</td>
    <td>Array is one of the commonly used data types in JSON scenarios. For inclusive queries in arrays, multi-value indexes can efficiently improve the query speed. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>TiFlash kernel optimization</td>
    <td><ul><li>FastScan provides weak consistency but faster table scan capability.</li><li>Further optimize the join order, shuffle, and exchange algorithms to improve computing efficiency and boost performance for complex queries.</li><li>Add a fine-grained data sharding mechanism to optimize the <code>COUNT(DISTINCT)</code> function and high cardinality aggregation.</li></ul></td>
    <td>Improve the basic computing capability of TiFlash, and optimize the performance and reliability of the underlying algorithms of the columnar storage and MPP engine.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>TiDB proxy</td>

    <td>By converting the execution of DDL tasks to distributed mode, this feature accelerates the execution speed of DDL tasks and improves the utilization of computing resources in the entire cluster. At present, DDL tasks that need to improve the speed include large table indexing and lossy column type modification tasks.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Non-prepared Plan Cache</td>
    <td>Support plan cache for general SQL statements in a session to save cache resources, improve the hit rate of general execution plans, and improve SQL performance.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SQL blocklist</td>
    <td>Support a rule-based SQL blocklist mechanism.</td>
    <td>In multi-service aggregation scenarios, provide SQL management and control capabilities, and improve cluster stability by prohibiting high-resource-consuming SQL statements.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Resource management</td>
    <td>Provide a basic resource management and control framework to effectively control the resource squeeze of background tasks on front-end tasks (user operations), and improve cluster stability.</td>
    <td>Refine resource management in the multi-service aggregation scenario.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Prepared Plan Cache</td>
    <td>Support in-session subquery, expression index, and prepared plan cache for Partition.</td>
    <td>Expand the usage scenarios of plan cache.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>PB-level scalability</td>
    <td>Support dynamic region size adjustment (heterogeneous).</td>
    <td>For scenarios with fast business growth and a large amount of data.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Instance plan cache</td>
    <td>Support cross-session plan cache, save cache resources, improve the hit rate of general execution plans, and improve SQL performance.</td>
    <td>In general scenarios, reuse execution plans to improve memory utilization and to achieve higher throughputs.</td>
