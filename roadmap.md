# TiDB Roadmap

This roadmap brings you what's coming in the 1-year future, so you can see the new features or improvements in advance, follow the progress, learn about the key milestones on the way, and give feedback as the development work goes on. In the course of development, this roadmap is subject to change based on user needs and feedback. If you have a feature request or want to prioritize a feature, please file an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues).

✅: The feature or improvement is already available in TiDB.

    <td><ul><li>Implement a DDL parallel execution framework.</li><li>Provide DDL pause/resume capability.</li></ul></td>
    <td>Implement a distributed parallel DDL execution framework, so that DDL tasks executed by only one TiDB Owner node can be coordinated and executed by all TiDB nodes in the cluster. Improve the execution speed of DDL tasks and cluster resource utilization.<br>By converting the execution of DDL tasks to distributed mode, this feature accelerates the execution speed of DDL tasks and improves the utilization of computing resources in the entire cluster. At present, DDL tasks that need to improve the speed include large table indexing and lossy column type modification tasks.</td>

The analysis results can be easily reused, which reduces unnecessary ad-hoc queries, improves the performance of BI and other applications (by pulling results directly) and reduces system load (by avoiding duplicated computation), thereby improving the overall data pipeline efficiency and reducing costs. It will make TiFlash an online service.</p></td>
