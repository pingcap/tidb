// Advisory Locks are the locks in GET_LOCK() and RELEASE_LOCK().
// We implement them in TiDB by using an INSERT into mysql.advisory_locks
// inside of a pessimistic transaction that is never committed.
//
// Each advisory lock requires its own session, since the pessimistic locks
// can be rolled back in any order (transactions can't release random locks
// like this even if savepoints was supported).
//
// We use referenceCount to track the number of references to the lock in the session.
// A little known feature of advisory locks is that you can call GET_LOCK
// multiple times on the same lock, and it will only be released when
// the reference count reaches zero.
