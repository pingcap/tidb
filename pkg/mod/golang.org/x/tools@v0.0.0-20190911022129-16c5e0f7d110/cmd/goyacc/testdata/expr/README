This directory contains a simple program demonstrating how to use
the Go version of yacc.

To build it:

	$ go generate
	$ go build

or

	$ go generate
	$ go run expr.go

The file main.go contains the "go generate" command to run yacc to
create expr.go from expr.y. It also has the package doc comment,
as godoc will not scan the .y file.

The actual implementation is in expr.y.

The program is not installed in the binary distributions of Go.
