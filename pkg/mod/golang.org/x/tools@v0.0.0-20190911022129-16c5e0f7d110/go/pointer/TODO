Pointer analysis to-do list
===========================

CONSTRAINT GENERATION:
- support reflection:
  - a couple of operators are missing
  - reflect.Values may contain lvalues (CanAddr)
- implement native intrinsics.  These vary by platform.
- add to pts(a.panic) a label representing all runtime panics, e.g.
  runtime.{TypeAssertionError,errorString,errorCString}.

OPTIMISATIONS
- pre-solver: 
  pointer equivalence: extend HVN to HRU
  location equivalence
- solver: HCD, LCD.
- experiment with map+slice worklist in lieu of bitset.
  It may have faster insert.

MISC:
- Test on all platforms.  
  Currently we assume these go/build tags: linux, amd64, !cgo.

MAINTAINABILITY
- Think about ways to make debugging this code easier.  PTA logs
  routinely exceed a million lines and require training to read.

BUGS: 
- There's a crash bug in stdlib_test + reflection, rVCallConstraint.
